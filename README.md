# Neural networks for image classification embracing the temporal dynamics of the ventral stream

Integrating oscillations into neural networks for multiplexing.
Note that these scripts are work in progress

## One-layer "toy model"

### /manual
network with one hidden layer, implemented without API
AET_model.py: module: network implemented using automatic differentiation & matrix multiplication 
AETZ_train.py: script training simple model on 4 stimuli, creates competitive network, plots to explore dynamics
 
### /aet_pytorch: manual network replicated (fully) in Pytorch (for GPU support)

## Deep Networks (in progress)

### /CSHL project
integrating dynamics into CORnet-Z (Kubilius et al., 2019, NeurIPS)

### /mnist
network with oscillations trained on MNIST data set 




/old: archived scripts
